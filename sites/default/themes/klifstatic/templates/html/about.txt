My name is Patrick Segarel, I am a web developer currently based in South China. I love solving problems with code & design, as well as bringing beautiful ideas to life.
With each project, my main objective is to create user-friendly and performant websites.

Feel free to contact me if you would like to talk about a specific project or see some of my previous work.<br/>
Iâ€™m also open to new opportunities and external cooperation.
